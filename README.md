# TEST THE BOT! https://discord.gg/VnhmjSc3 -- BETA, INCLUDES WIP STUFF.
This is a solid guide for people who want to make a discord-bot with no effort. I will post a tutorial on youtube soon!


First, go to https://console.groq.com/keys and make a key, copy the key.
go to .env paste that key.
then go your bot and get your bot token and paste it in .env
go to https://client.pylexnodes.net/ and make a server.
then go to https://client.pylexnodes.net/account and change your password.
after changing your password go to https://free.pylexnodes.net
select your server, go to files and upload the files to the server. 
then go to startup, additional node packages and put this in there "discord.js dotenv groq-sdk chalk" without the "". after putting that start it.
if you have any problems dm me at deadlyspace_
